This is a Python script, that let's you open API-Sessions with the Voi System, to be able to retrieve information about the current scooter state around the globe.

Information
-----------

|Because I'm pretty much interested in the number of the rented scooters in my city, the goal here is to develop an algorithm which detects if a scooter that goes offline, if it has been rented by a customer or if it was retired for recharging or maintenance purposes by the scooter company.
|Please consider this as under development.
|There is still much much work to do.

How to use
----------

The .py files are located in ./venv/src.
To use the Voi-Api, what you need is an authToken. This authToken is generated by entering and confirming your mobile phone number and your E-Mail address.
So, please generate the authToken first by running getauthtoken.py first.
By running main.py, the current number of available scooters in Nuremberg will be attached to statistik.txt every minute; This file might be renamend in the near future.

Thank you
